# NgrxMoviesRank
Demo: [link](https://kyleleow.github.io/ngrx-movies-rank/)
1. Uses only one custom UI component `<app-list>` that includes a table list and a button, all design are custom-coded, no external UI libraries were used
2. Calls a mock API by using `http.get()` to retrieve local JSON file to be used as movies data
3. Using `ngRx` for state management
4. Every time when user click on `Start Rating` button, a random number of seconds of timer will be created, and shown besides the button text
5. Upon reaching `0` , an action will be dispatched to the `store` and return a new list with random items given with a new random rating of 1-10
6. Unless `Stop Rating` is clicked, Step 4 - 5 will be repeated endlessly
7. This project is **mobile-responsive**
